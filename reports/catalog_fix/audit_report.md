# Sterling Sign Solutions - Products Catalog Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
**Priority**: HIGH - Multiple 404s and broken product routes
**Impact**: Poor user experience, lost conversions, SEO issues

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Products Index Page (`/pages/products/index.tsx`)

**✅ WORKING:**
- Product grid layout with responsive design
- Search and filtering functionality
- ETA calculations with ZIP code input
- Analytics tracking integration

**❌ CRITICAL ISSUES:**
- **Broken Product Links**: Links to `/products/${product.id.toLowerCase()}` but product IDs are like `BAN-13OZ` → `/products/ban-13oz`
- **Missing Product Images**: Uses `/images/products/${code.toLowerCase()}.jpg` but actual images have different naming
- **No Static Generation**: Uses client-side data generation instead of SSG
- **Inconsistent Slug Mapping**: Product IDs don't match expected slugs

### 2. Product Detail Pages (`/pages/products/[slug].tsx`)

**✅ WORKING:**
- Basic product page structure
- SEO optimization with meta tags
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Hero section with images

**❌ CRITICAL ISSUES:**
- **Limited Product Data**: Only 3 hardcoded products (`vinyl-banner`, `aluminum-sign`, `door-hours-decal`)
- **API Dependency**: Tries to fetch from `/api/pricing` but mapping is incomplete
- **Missing Products**: Most products from pricing table have no corresponding PDP
- **No Static Generation**: No `getStaticPaths` or `getStaticProps`

### 3. Data Sources

**✅ AVAILABLE:**
- `data/pricing/pricing_normalized.json` - Complete product catalog with 18+ products
- `lib/pricing.ts` - Comprehensive pricing configuration
- Some product images in `/public/images/products/`

**❌ MISSING:**
- Unified product catalog with proper slug mapping
- Consistent image naming convention
- Product descriptions and specifications
- Category organization

### 4. Image Assets

**✅ EXISTING IMAGES:**
```
/public/images/products/
├── aluminum-hero.jpg
├── banner-hero.jpg
├── banner1-hero.jpg
├── blueprints-hero.jpg
├── door-hours-hero.jpg
└── room number-hero.jpg
```

**❌ MISSING IMAGES:**
- Most products have no corresponding images
- Inconsistent naming (some use `-hero.jpg`, others don't)
- No placeholder system for missing images

## Route Analysis

### 4. User Experience Issues:

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact:

- **Brand Damage**: Unprofessional appearance

### Technical Impact:
